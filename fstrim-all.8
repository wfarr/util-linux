.TH fstrim-all 8 "Dec 2013" "" "Debian Administrator's Manual"

.SH NAME
fstrim-all \- call fstrim on all mounted file systems which support it

.SH DESCRIPTION

SSD drives need to be TRIMed, i. e. they need to be told which blocks the OS
considers as "unused" (i. e. from deleted files). Withouth this, the write
speed on SSDs becomes slower over time.

.B fstrim\-all
detects which mounted partitions belong to drives that need/support trimming,
and calls
.BR fstrim (1)
on them.

It is meant to be called from cron. There is no output on success.
